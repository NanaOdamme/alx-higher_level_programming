# JavaScript Basics

Welcome to the JavaScript Basics guide! This README.md provides an overview of various fundamental topics in JavaScript programming.

## Why JavaScript programming is amazing
JavaScript is versatile and powerful. Its ability to run both on the client-side and server-side makes it a go-to language for web development. Its vast ecosystem, frameworks, and libraries make it a favorite among developers.

## How to run a JavaScript script
To run a JavaScript script:
1. Create a `.js` file (e.g., `script.js`).
2. Add your JavaScript code.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `.js` file.
4. Run `node script.js`.

## How to create variables and constants
- **Variables**: Use `var`, `let`, or `const` followed by the variable name.
- **Constants**: Use `const` followed by the constant name. Constants cannot be reassigned.

## Differences between var, const, and let
- `var`: Function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated.
- `let`: Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared.
- `const`: Block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared after initialization.

## Data types available in JavaScript
JavaScript has several data types:
- Primitive types: `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `Symbol`.
- Objects: `Object`, `Array`, `Function`.

## How to use if, if...else statements
Use `if` for conditional execution and `if...else` for branching based on conditions.

## How to use comments
Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.

## How to affect values to variables
Assign values using the assignment operator `=`. Example: `let x = 10;`.

## How to use while and for loops
- `while`: Executes a block of code while a condition is true.
- `for`: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.

## How to use break and continue statements
- `break`: Exits the loop.
- `continue`: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.

## What is a function and how do you use functions
A function is a reusable block of code. Use the `function` keyword followed by the function name and parameters. Example: 
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## What does a function that does not use any return statement return
A function that doesn't use a `return` statement returns `undefined`.

## Scope of variables
Variables have different scopes: global scope, function scope, and block scope (`let` and `const`).

## Arithmetic operators and how to use them
Arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, and `--`. Use them for mathematical operations.

## How to manipulate dictionary
In JavaScript, dictionaries are represented as objects. Use dot notation or bracket notation to access or modify properties.

## How to import a file
In JavaScript (Node.js), use `require` to import modules or other `.js` files. Example: `const module = require('./module.js');`.
